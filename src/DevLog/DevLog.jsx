                                    <br/>
                                    This is the humble beginnings of my system. After many hours and rebuilds, I was
                                    finally able to reach this point, a working prototype!
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    I've gone with a full NodeJS stack, with a NoSQL database.

                                    <br/>

                                    You can find the code for the individual projects here:

                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <a href="#">Raspberry Pi Script</a>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <a href="#">Rest API</a>
                                        </li>
                                        <li className="mt-0">
                                            <a href="#">React Web App</a>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    After I debug this for a bit longer, the next steps will be to create a prototype
                                    board that will condense and secure everything. I should also look into adding LEDs
                                    to serve as indicators, would help a lot with debugging without having to connect
                                    directly to the Raspberry Pi.

                                        not that easy to see, but I added 4 indicator lights for 'at a glance'
